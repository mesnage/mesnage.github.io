      <h2 style="padding: 10px">Effects of pesticides on the gut microbiome </h2>
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">There is intense debate on whether glyphosate can inhibit the shikimate pathway of gastrointestinal microorganisms, with potential health implications. We combined shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics to assess effects of glyphosate on the caecum microbiota of Sprague-Dawley rats. <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP6990">(Mesnage et al., 2021)</a>. Accumulation of shikimic acid suggested inhibition of the shikimate pathway. Shotgun metagenomics of the rat caecum showed that treatment with glyphosate resulted in higher levels of Eggerthella spp., Shinella zoogleoides, Acinetobacter johnsonii and Akkermansia muciniphila. Altered cecum metabolites were not differentially expressed in serum, suggesting that the glyphosate impact on gut microbial metabolism had limited consequences on physiological biochemistry. Serum metabolites indicated a response to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress was even more pronounced when we tested a commercial herbicide containing glyphosate called Roundup Bioflow (also known as MON 52276, the representative glyphosate herbicide in the EU).</h5>
    
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> We then evaluated if urinary glyphosate excretion associates with changes in faecal microbial community composition and metabolite profiles in 65 adult twins in the UK. This is part of a larger project in which we are comparing the effects of organic and non-organic diets on the composition of the gut microbiota of adult twins from the TwinsUK cohort. The results of this study are currently being drafted. </h5>
      
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> We also compared standard histopathology and serum biochemistry measures and multi-omics analyses in a subchronic toxicity test of a mixture of six pesticides frequently detected in foodstuffs (azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, imidacloprid and thiabendazole) in Sprague-Dawley rats  <a href="https://www.nature.com/commsbio/">(Mesnage et al., 2021)</a>. Analysis of water and feed consumption, body weight, histopathology and serum biochemistry showed little effect. Contrastingly, serum and caecum metabolomics suggested activation of an oxidative stress response. Transcriptomics and genome-wide DNA methylation analysisof the liver reflected the regulation of response to steroid hormones and the activation of stress response pathways. This demonstrated that in-depth molecular profiling in laboratory animals exposed to low concentrations of pesticides allows the detection of metabolic perturbations that would remain undetected by standard regulatory biochemical measures and which could thus improve the predictability of health risks from exposure to chemical pollutants. </h5>

     <h2 style="padding: 10px">Genotoxicity of glyphosate and its formulated products</h2>
    
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> Toxicity including genotoxicity of glyphosate alone has been repeatedly tested over the last 40 years. Contrastingly, few studies have conducted comparative investigations between glyphosate and its commercial herbicide formulations, such as Roundup. We performed the first in-depth comparative toxicogenomic evaluation of glyphosate and a typical European Union Roundup formulation by determining alterations in transcriptome and epigenome profiles. Histopathology and serum biochemistry analysis showed that MON 52276 but not glyphosate treatment was associated with a statistically significant increase in hepatic steatosis and necrosis. Similar lesions were also present in the liver of glyphosate-treated groups but not in the control group. MON 52276 altered the expression of 96 genes in liver, with the most affected biological functions being TP53 activation by DNA damage and oxidative stress as well as the regulation of circadian rhythms. The most affected genes in liver also had their expression similarly altered in kidneys. DNA methylation profiling of liver revealed differentially methylated CpG sites between the control group and the group of rats exposed to glyphosate and MON 52276 which can serve as biomarkers and potential predictors of negative health outcomes resulting from exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides. Direct DNA damage by measurement of apurinic/apyrimidinic lesions in liver was increased with glyphosate exposure. A panel of six mouse embryonic reporter stem cell lines validated to identify carcinogenic outcomes (DNA damage, oxidative stress, and protein misfolding) were used to provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of glyphosate and 3 Roundup formulations. This showed that two Roundup herbicides but not glyphosate activated oxidative stress and misfolded protein responses. However, no activation of a DNA damage response and p53-mediated cellular stress was observed. Collectively, this suggested that Roundup herbicides are not directly genotoxic. However, they can cause DNA damages which are secondary to oxidative stress and inflammation.

     <h2 style="padding: 10px">Molecular signatures of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</h2>

<h5 style="padding: 10px">Since the exposure to a glyphosate formulated product caused a phenotype overlaying those of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-015-0056-1">(Mesnage et al., 2015)</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39328">(Mesnage et al., 2017)</a>(Mesnage et al., 2015, Mesnage et al., 2017), we evaluated if liver cells can be affect by glyphosate and its formulations in vitro. For this purpose, we developed a sensitive assay combining transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches to reveal molecular signatures of NAFLD. First of all, we described the alterations in gene expression profiles and metabolite levels in the human HepaRG liver cell line exposed to the polychlorinated biphenyl 126 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018304244?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2018a)</a>.  Exposure to PCB 126 provoked a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as an increase in sphingolipid levels, concomitant with a decrease in the activity of genes involved in lipid metabolism. These changes were observed even at the lowest concentration tested. </h5>

<h5 style="padding: 10px">We then used HepaRG cells to investigate toxic effects of pesticides  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018304244?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2018b)</a>. We focused on quizalofop-p-ethyl, isoxaflutole, mesotrione and glyphosate as use of herbicides containing these active principles is predicted to rapidly increase in coming years in an effort to overcome the wide-spread appearance of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Quizalofop-p-ethyl was found to alter lipid metabolism. Glyphosate only caused subtle changes in the gene expression profiles of liver cells.  </h5>

     <h2 style="padding: 10px">Endocrine disrupting effects of pesticides</h2>
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is a risk factor for obesity. Although some pesticides have been shown to act as obesogens, the most commonly used pesticide active principles have never been tested in an adipogenesis assay. Given the increasing use of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, mesotrione, isoxaflutole, quizalofop-p-ethyl and glyphosate, we have evaluated their obesogenic potential using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results showed that quizalofop-p-ethyl has the most pronounced adipogenic (lipid accumulation) effect <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/170/2/452/5472348">(Biserni et al., 2019)</a>.</h5>
      
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">Few studies have investigated non‐target effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on mammalian physiology. We describe the first investigation evaluating the interaction of seven principal neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin, flupyradifurone, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, thiacloprid) with oestrogen and thyroid hormone receptors, as well as their adipogenic effects <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/170/2/452/5472348">(Mesnage et al., 2018c)</a>. Our study showed that imidacloprid could be a potential obesogen as it promoted lipid accumulation in 3T3‐L1 cells.</h5>
  
<h5 style="padding: 10px">The endocrine disruptive capability, of glyphosate-based herbicides is a matter of intense debate. We evaluated the estrogenic potential of glyphosate using breast cancer cells <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691517303976?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2017a)</a>. We collaborated with the US EPA to study estrogenic effects of glyphosate with a biomarker of Estrogen Receptor Alpha activation using RNA-sequencing technologies. The quantum mechanical behaviour of glyphosate was also assessed using molecular dynamic simulation. Glyphosate only activated ERa at very high concentrations.</h5>

      <h2 style="padding: 10px">Toxic effects of pesticide co-formulants</h2>
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">My research studies on glyphosate started in 2008 when I joined the group of Pr. Séralini at the University of Caen in France. During this period, my main focus was the comparison of the toxic effects of glyphosate to those of its commercial formulations. I published the first study linking the concentration of ethoxylated surfactants to the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300483X12003459?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2013)</a>. I showed that ethoxylated tallow amine surfactants were more toxic than other surfactants, an important result which was used to the ban of this compound from glyphosate-based herbicides in Europe.</h5>
      
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">In a follow-up study, I investigated 9 active ingredients. They were selected from herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides of different classes which are used for agricultural or domestic purposes, from the major pesticides used worldwide. I found that 8 formulations out of 9 were up to one thousand times more toxic than their active principles on the three cell lines tested <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/179691/">(Mesnage et al., 2014)</a>.</h5>
    
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">I am still pursuing this area of research nowadays. I am regularly invited to speak about this topic in scientific conferences and public events, such as at the European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/pastevents.html?month=06-2018&eventType=&body=">PEST hearing</a> on authorisation of plant protection products by Member States. I regularly publish new studies in which I compare the study the human health implications of the difference in toxicity between active ingredients and their formulations (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691519301814?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2019)</a>)</h5>
