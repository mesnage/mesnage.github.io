      <h2 style="padding: 10px">Effects of pesticides on the gut microbiome </h2>
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">Health effects of pesticides are not always correctly predicted before products are released for marketing. Laboratory studies are often insufficient to detect effects of pesticides. This is the case for effects on the gut microbiome which are generally not measured in the battery of tests performed to regulate pesticide adverse effects.</h5>

<h5 style="padding: 10px">Effects of the major herbicide glyphosate on the gut microbiome are heavily debated. Because glyphosate can target the metabolism of gastrointestinal microorganisms in the same manner it targets plants to act as a weedkiller, major concerns have been raised regarding the potential antibiotic effects of glyphosate. However, this had never been tested. We combined high-throughput biology techniques (shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics) to assess effects of glyphosate on the caecum microbiota of Sprague-Dawley rats. <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP6990">(Mesnage et al., 2021)</a>. Glyphosate did not act as an antibiotic in the gut. In order for glyphosate to act as an antibiotic, it needs to cause a significant shortage in the production of compounds in bacteria called aromatic amino acids. This is how glyphosate kills plants. More specifically, it interrupts a series of chemical reactions within the shikimate pathway. We reveal for the first time that glyphosate does inhibit the shikimate pathway in the rat gut microbiome. This could have health impact. However, glyphosate likely did not kill bacteria via its impact on the shikimate pathway, because bacteria do not need the shikimate pathway to get the aromatic amino acids they need. Like us, they get them from the food we eat.</h5>
    
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> Glyphosate’s impact on the shikimate pathway had other consequences. A multitude of small molecules (metabolites) accumulated, or were depleted in the rat gut. The bacterial composition of the gut microbiome also changed, with some bacteria present at higher levels in the glyphosate exposed animals. We have an explanation for this: the glyphosate molecule contains one atom of phosphorus, and it is very likely that this phosphorus was used as a source of energy by some bacteria to proliferate in the rat gut.</h5>
    
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> We evaluated this by measuring if the changes in gut microbiome chemistry caused changes in blood composition. The compounds altered as a consequence of the interruption of the shikimate pathway by glyphosate in the gut were mostly unchanged in blood. However, other chemicals had their levels disrupted by glyphosate, with some indicating that glyphosate caused oxidative stress. This oxidative stress was even more pronounced when we tested a commercial herbicide containing glyphosate called Roundup Bioflow (also known as MON 52276, the representative glyphosate herbicide in the EU).</h5>
    
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> We then evaluated if urinary glyphosate excretion associates with changes in faecal microbial community composition and metabolite profiles in 65 adult twins in the UK. This is part of a larger project in which we are comparing the effects of organic and non-organic diets on the composition of the gut microbiota of adult twins from the TwinsUK cohort. This study was done in the UK on 124 individuals. The results of this study are currently submitted for publication. </h5>
      
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> Since laboratory studies are often insufficient to detect effects of a cumulative exposure to multiple pesticides at environmental levels of exposure, we tested whether the application of the most recent high-throughput technologies could improve the accuracy of toxicity tests. For this purpose, We compared standard histopathology and serum biochemistry measures and multi-omics analyses in a subchronic toxicity test of a mixture of six pesticides frequently detected in foodstuffs (azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, imidacloprid and thiabendazole) in Sprague-Dawley rats  <a href="https://www.nature.com/commsbio/">(Mesnage et al., 2021)</a>. Analysis of water and feed consumption, body weight, histopathology and serum biochemistry showed little effect. Contrastingly, serum and caecum metabolomics suggested activation of an oxidative stress response. Transcriptomics and genome-wide DNA methylation analysisof the liver reflected the regulation of response to steroid hormones and the activation of stress response pathways. This demonstrated that in-depth molecular profiling in laboratory animals exposed to low concentrations of pesticides allows the detection of metabolic perturbations that would remain undetected by standard regulatory biochemical measures and which could thus improve the predictability of health risks from exposure to chemical pollutants. </h5>

     <h2 style="padding: 10px">Genotoxicity of glyphosate and its formulated products</h2>
    
    <h5 style="padding: 10px"> Carcinogenic effects of glyphosate-based herbicides is an intense matter of debate. Toxicity including genotoxicity of glyphosate alone has been repeatedly tested over the last 40 years. Contrastingly, few studies have conducted comparative investigations between glyphosate and its commercial herbicide formulations, such as Roundup. This comparison is key to understand if cancers possibly developed after exposures to Roundup formulations can be predicted by laboratory tests done with glyphosate alone. </h5>

  <h5 style="padding: 10px"> We performed the first in-depth comparative toxicogenomic evaluation of glyphosate and Roundup formulations <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.12.439463v1">(Mesnage et al., 2021)</a>. This was first done by evaluating effects of glyphosate and Roundup at a profound molecular level of biological functioning through analysis of gene expression (transcriptomics) and epigenetics (DNA methylation) in rat tissues. Roundup altered the expression of 96 genes in the rat liver specifically linked to DNA damage and oxidative stress. The genes disturbed suggested the activation of DNA repair mechanisms. Direct DNA damage measurement by apurinic/apyrimidinic lesion formation in liver was increased with glyphosate exposure. Although a core set of genes whose expression was altered by Roundup was similarly changed in the glyphosate-treated animals, the Roundup formulation was more toxic. </h5>

<h5 style="padding: 10px"> We did more laboratory tests in vitro to understand if glyphosate or Roundup can activate mechanisms which can lead to cancer formation. Glyphosate and three Roundup formulations were assessed. We found that two formulations of Roundup herbicide, but not glyphosate, activated oxidative stress and misfolded protein responses, both clear markers of carcinogenicity. This suggested that surfactants in formulations have their own toxic effects and their combination with glyphosate trigger cell mechanisms characteristic of cancer formation which are not activated by glyphosate alone.</h5>

     <h2 style="padding: 10px">Molecular signatures of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</h2>

<h5 style="padding: 10px">Since the exposure to a glyphosate formulated product caused a phenotype overlaying those of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-015-0056-1">(Mesnage et al., 2015)</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39328">(Mesnage et al., 2017)</a>(Mesnage et al., 2015, Mesnage et al., 2017), we evaluated if liver cells can be affect by glyphosate and its formulations in vitro. For this purpose, we developed a sensitive assay combining transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches to reveal molecular signatures of NAFLD. First of all, we described the alterations in gene expression profiles and metabolite levels in the human HepaRG liver cell line exposed to the polychlorinated biphenyl 126 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018304244?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2018a)</a>.  Exposure to PCB 126 provoked a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as an increase in sphingolipid levels, concomitant with a decrease in the activity of genes involved in lipid metabolism. These changes were observed even at the lowest concentration tested. </h5>

<h5 style="padding: 10px">We then used HepaRG cells to investigate toxic effects of pesticides  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018304244?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2018b)</a>. We focused on quizalofop-p-ethyl, isoxaflutole, mesotrione and glyphosate as use of herbicides containing these active principles is predicted to rapidly increase in coming years in an effort to overcome the wide-spread appearance of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Quizalofop-p-ethyl was found to alter lipid metabolism. Glyphosate only caused subtle changes in the gene expression profiles of liver cells.  </h5>

     <h2 style="padding: 10px">Endocrine disrupting effects of pesticides</h2>
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is a risk factor for obesity. Although some pesticides have been shown to act as obesogens, the most commonly used pesticide active principles have never been tested in an adipogenesis assay. Given the increasing use of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, mesotrione, isoxaflutole, quizalofop-p-ethyl and glyphosate, we have evaluated their obesogenic potential using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results showed that quizalofop-p-ethyl has the most pronounced adipogenic (lipid accumulation) effect <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/170/2/452/5472348">(Biserni et al., 2019)</a>.</h5>
      
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">Few studies have investigated non‐target effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on mammalian physiology. We describe the first investigation evaluating the interaction of seven principal neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin, flupyradifurone, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, thiacloprid) with oestrogen and thyroid hormone receptors, as well as their adipogenic effects <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/170/2/452/5472348">(Mesnage et al., 2018c)</a>. Our study showed that imidacloprid could be a potential obesogen as it promoted lipid accumulation in 3T3‐L1 cells.</h5>
  
<h5 style="padding: 10px">The endocrine disruptive capability, of glyphosate-based herbicides is a matter of intense debate. We evaluated the estrogenic potential of glyphosate using breast cancer cells <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691517303976?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2017a)</a>. We collaborated with the US EPA to study estrogenic effects of glyphosate with a biomarker of Estrogen Receptor Alpha activation using RNA-sequencing technologies. The quantum mechanical behaviour of glyphosate was also assessed using molecular dynamic simulation. Glyphosate only activated ERa at very high concentrations.</h5>

      <h2 style="padding: 10px">Toxic effects of pesticide co-formulants</h2>
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">My research studies on glyphosate started in 2008 when I joined the group of Pr. Séralini at the University of Caen in France. During this period, my main focus was the comparison of the toxic effects of glyphosate to those of its commercial formulations. I published the first study linking the concentration of ethoxylated surfactants to the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300483X12003459?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2013)</a>. I showed that ethoxylated tallow amine surfactants were more toxic than other surfactants, an important result which was used to the ban of this compound from glyphosate-based herbicides in Europe.</h5>
      
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">In a follow-up study in 2014, I investigated 9 active ingredients. They were selected from herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides of different classes which are used for agricultural or domestic purposes, from the major pesticides used worldwide. I found that 8 formulations out of 9 were up to one thousand times more toxic than their active principles on the three cell lines tested <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/179691/">(Mesnage et al., 2014)</a>.</h5>
    
      <h5 style="padding: 10px">I am still pursuing this area of research. Pesticide active ingredients are compared to their commercial formulations in most of the studies I performed to evaluate genotoxicity <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.12.439463v1">(Mesnage et al., 2021)</a>, endocrine disrupting effects <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691517303976?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2017a)</a>, obesogenic potential <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/170/2/452/5472348">(Biserni et al., 2019)</a> or effects on the gut microbiome <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP6990">(Mesnage et al., 2021)</a>. I regularly publish reviews on the topic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691519301814?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2019)</a>, to provide clarification of the composition of pesticide formulations based on information available from the scientific literature, patents, industry publications. I also addressed the toxicity of co-formulants in a book on herbicide in concise language appropriate to engage both specialists in the research community and informed persons responsible for legislative, funding, and public health matters in the community at large <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/herbicides/mesnage/978-0-12-823674-1">(Mesnage and Zaller, 2021)</a>.
        
        I am regularly invited to speak about this topic in scientific conferences and public events, such as at the European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/pastevents.html?month=06-2018&eventType=&body=">PEST hearing</a> on authorisation of plant protection products by Member States. </h5>
