<h2>My Research</h2>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
My research focus over the last 10 years has been on the safety evaluation of environmental contaminants, including pesticides, publishing around 50 scientific articles on this subject. In the sections below, I describe important milestones from this research programme.</p><br>

<br>
<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>2019 – 2020 : Effects of pesticides on the gut microbiome</h3>

<br>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
There is intense debate on whether pesticides residues interference with the metabolism of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract can be a source of negative health impacts. We have addressed this major gap in glyphosate toxicology by using a multi-omics strategy combining shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics analyses <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/870105v1">(Mesnage et al., 2019)</a>. Glyphosate and its herbicide formulation MON 52276 (both at 0.5, 50, 175 mg glyphosate/kg bw/day) caused an accumulation of shikimic acid and 3-dehydroshikimic acid in the Sprague-Dawley rat caecum microbiome after a 90-day exposure. This suggests that glyphosate inhibited the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, which is its primary mode of action in plants to act as a weedkiller. Histopathological evaluations showed that MON 52276 but not glyphosate caused a statistically significant increase in hepatic steatosis and necrosis. Although we could not establish which bacteria are causing the changes in gut microbiome functional capacities, shotgun metagenomics showed that glyphosate affected increased levels of Eggerthella spp. and Homeothermacea spp. 
<br><br>
We then evaluated if glyphosate exposure in human populations at environmental levels in the British population could also affect the gut microbiome. This is part of a larger project in which we are comparing the effects of organic and non-organic diets on the composition of the gut microbiota of adult twins from the TwinsUK cohort. A total of 571 pesticides are measured in the urine in 65 twin pairs that are discordant for an organic diet – in other words, where one of the twins eats an organic diet whilst the other does not. High-throughput DNA sequencing of the complete genomes of all the microorganisms constituting the gut microbiota will allow correlations to be made between an organic diet, pesticide body burden, gut microbiome status and health/disease indicators.</p><br>

<br>
<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>2017-2018: Molecular signatures of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</h3>
 
<br>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
Since the exposure to a glyphosate formulated product caused a phenotype overlaying those of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-015-0056-1">(Mesnage et al., 2015)</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39328">(Mesnage et al., 2017)</a>(Mesnage et al., 2015, Mesnage et al., 2017), we evaluated if liver cells can be affect by glyphosate and its formulations in vitro. For this purpose, we developed a sensitive assay combining transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches to reveal molecular signatures of NAFLD. First of all, we described the alterations in gene expression profiles and metabolite levels in the human HepaRG liver cell line exposed to the polychlorinated biphenyl 126 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018304244?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2018a)</a>.  Exposure to PCB 126 provoked a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as an increase in sphingolipid levels, concomitant with a decrease in the activity of genes involved in lipid metabolism. These changes were observed even at the lowest concentration tested. 
<br><br>
We then used HepaRG cells to investigate toxic effects of pesticides  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018304244?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2018b)</a>. We focused on quizalofop-p-ethyl, isoxaflutole, mesotrione and glyphosate as use of herbicides containing these active principles is predicted to rapidly increase in coming years in an effort to overcome the wide-spread appearance of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Quizalofop-p-ethyl was found to alter lipid metabolism. Glyphosate only caused subtle changes in the gene expression profiles of liver cells. </p><br>


<br>
<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>2016 – 2017: Obesogenic effects of endocrine disruptors</h3>

<br>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is a risk factor for obesity. Although some pesticides have been shown to act as obesogens, the most commonly used pesticide active principles have never been tested in an adipogenesis assay. Given the increasing use of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, mesotrione, isoxaflutole, quizalofop-p-ethyl and glyphosate, we have evaluated their obesogenic potential using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results showed that quizalofop-p-ethyl has the most pronounced adipogenic (lipid accumulation) effect <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/170/2/452/5472348">(Biserni et al., 2019)</a>.
<br><br>
Few studies have investigated non‐target effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on mammalian physiology. We describe the first investigation evaluating the interaction of seven principal neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin, flupyradifurone, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, thiacloprid) with oestrogen and thyroid hormone receptors, as well as their adipogenic effects <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/170/2/452/5472348">(Mesnage et al., 2018c)</a>. Our study showed that imidacloprid could be a potential obesogen as it promoted lipid accumulation in 3T3‐L1 cells.</p><br>


<br>
<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>2015 – 2016: Estrogenic effects of glyphosate and bisphenol A alternatives</h3>

<br>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
The endocrine disruptive capability, of glyphosate-based herbicides is a matter of intense debate. We evaluated the estrogenic potential of glyphosate using breast cancer cells <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691517303976?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2017a)</a>. We collaborated with the US EPA to study estrogenic effects of glyphosate with a biomarker of Estrogen Receptor Alpha activation using RNA-sequencing technologies. The quantum mechanical behaviour of glyphosate was also assessed using molecular dynamic simulation. Glyphosate only activated ERa at very high concentrations.
<br><br>
We also investigated estrogenic effects of bisphenol A (BPA) variants in 3 human breast cancer cell lines <a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/158/2/431/3849675">(Mesnage et al., 2017b)</a>. We found that BPA alternatives are not necessarily less estrogenic than BPA in human breast cancer cells. BPAF, BPB, and BPZ were more estrogenic than BPA. This study was published in the official journal of the Society of toxicology Toxicological Sciences, and highlighted by the Editor-in-Chief of the cover of journal. The EPA issued a press release to ‘highlight the need for testing of replacement chemicals prior to their introduction into commerce to demonstrate that they are safer than the chemical being replaced.’ Our study has subsequently be used as the basis of a new bill by the State of New York.</p><br>


<br>
<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>2014-2015: Integrating multiple ‘omics’ analysis to study the effects of herbicide-tolerant crops</h3>

<br>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
Safety concerns arising from the consumption of herbicide-tolerant crops remained a controversial topic after the publication of the first long-term toxicity study of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant GM maize. This study was retracted because the conclusions were not substantiated by the experimental data. I was hired by the group of Dr. Michael Antoniou at King’s College London to evaluate if the molecular profiles (proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) of liver and kidneys from animals of this study could reveal more insights into the toxicity of Roundup and the Roundup-tolerant GM crop tested in the “Séralini study”.
<br><br>
Molecular profiles from liver and kidneys of animals fed GM crops (sprayed or not with Roundup) indicated that these products did not alter organ function. This clearly indicated that no adverse effects related to the feeding of the NK603 maize cultivated with or without Roundup were observed <a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-017-0105-1">(Mesnage et al., 2017c)</a>. The absence of pathological effects from the consumption of glyphosate-tolerant crops was further confirmed by other projects. I participated to some of these projects more recently by analysing the gut microbiome composition in Wistar rats fed NK603 and MON 810 GM maize for 6 months <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691519303229?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2019)</a>, at two concentrations (11 and 33%). Our analysis showed that the different maize diets have not caused changes in microbiome composition.
<br><br>
Although there was no effects when animals were fed NK603 GM corn, liver molecular profiles suggested the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease for animals exposed to the Roundup herbicide in their drinking water. Overall, transcriptome, metabolome and proteome disturbances showed a substantial overlap with biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its progression to steatohepatosis <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-015-0056-1">(Mesnage et al., 2015)</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39328">(Mesnage et al., 2017d)</a>.
<br><br>
We evaluated compositional differences between the NK603 GM corn and its isogenic counterpart using metabolomics and proteomics <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37855">(Mesnage et al., 2016)</a>. This revealed energy metabolism changes which can be linked to the insertion of the transgene. The maize kernels analysed were previously used in a chronic study investigating the potential toxic effects arising from the consumption of the NK603 Roundup-tolerant GM maize in rats. I analysed the transcriptome and metabolome of liver and kidneys from this study <a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-017-0105-1">(Mesnage et al., 2017c)</a> . There were no statistically significant differences that we could attribute to the consumption of the NK603 Roundup-tolerant GM crop (with our without Roundup application during cultivation). This suggested that the metabolic changes caused by the transgene insertion are not toxicologically relevant.
<br><br>
A large number of animal toxicity tests have been performed with herbicide-tolerant crops. The available scientific evidence indicates that the potential adverse health effects arising from GM crops are not different from those created by conventional breeding practices. The main lesson learned from 20 years of animal feeding trials with GM crops is that animal feeding trials with whole food/feed are largely irreproducible because they have a low power to detect adverse effects. The use of ‘omics’ approaches can improve the predictive ability of these tests, as well as the accuracy of the comparative analysis of chemical composition. Future health risk evaluations would benefit from the use of high-throughput ‘omics’ technologies.  </p><br>

<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>2011-2013: Long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant GM maize</h3>

<br>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
The contamination of foodstuffs by glyphosate residues has been linked to its use on crops which have been made tolerant to agricultural applications of Roundup herbicides. Debates on the safety of these products prompted the realisation of long-term studies <a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2190-4715-23-10">(Séralini et al., 2011)</a>.  I participated to the analysis and publication of the results of the first long-term toxicity study of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant GM maize <a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5">(Séralini et al, 2014)</a>. When the study was published in 2012, it was widely criticised because the experimental design was insufficient to produce conclusions strong enough to be usable in guiding policy reforms. It was then retracted because it was found to be inconclusive <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637">(Séralini et al., 2012)</a>. Conflicts of interests, confidentiality and censorship in health risk assessment of these products were then discussed <a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-014-0013-6">(Séralini et al., 2014)</a>. More insights where needed to understand if the Roundup herbicide and the GM crop tested could contribute to the development of pathologies. I was ultimately hired by the group of Dr. Michael Antoniou at King’s College London to evaluate if the molecular profiles (proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) of liver and kidneys from animals of this study could reveal toxic effects of the GMO and Roundup.
<br><br>
Contamination of rodent diets by environmental pollutants can profoundly impact results of different studies. The quality of diets in rodent feeding trials is crucial. We described the contamination by environmental pollutants in 13 laboratory rodent diets from 5 continents <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128429">(Mesnage et al., 2015)</a>. All diets were contaminated with pesticides (1-6 out of 262 measured), heavy metals (2-3 out of 4, mostly lead and cadmium), PCDD/Fs (1-13 out of 17) and PCBs (5-15 out of 18). Toxic effects of these pollutants are well documented. These contaminations could partly explain why populations of laboratory rodents across the world develop high rates of so-called “spontaneous” diseases. They can also confound data interpretation.</p><br>

<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>2009 – 2011: Effects of pesticides in comparison to their active ingredients</h3>

<br>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}"> 
My research studies on glyphosate started in 2008 when I joined the group of Pr. Séralini at the University of Caen in France. During this period, my main focus was the comparison of the toxic effects of glyphosate to those of its commercial formulations. I published the first study linking the concentration of ethoxylated surfactants to the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X12003459?via%3Dihub">(Mesnage et al., 2013)</a>. I showed that ethoxylated tallow amine surfactants were more toxic than other surfactants, an important result which was used to the ban of this compound from glyphosate-based herbicides in Europe.
<br><br>
In a follow-up study, I investigated 9 active ingredients. They were selected from herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides of different classes which are used for agricultural or domestic purposes, from the major pesticides used worldwide. I found that 8 formulations out of 9 were up to one thousand times more toxic than their active principles on the three cell lines tested <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/179691/">(Mesnage et al., 2014)</a>.
<br><br>
I am still pursuing this area of research nowadays. I am regularly invited to speak about this topic in scientific conferences and public events, such as at the European Parliament PEST hearing on authorisation of plant protection products by Member States. I regularly publish new studies in which I compare the study the human health implications of the difference in toxicity between active ingredients and their formulations <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691519301814?via%3Dihub">(e.g. Mesnage et al., 2019)</a>. </p><br>
